# AudioBookShelf Sync Reverse Matching

A Ruby script that syncs your Goodreads "read" books with your AudioBookShelf library by marking matching books as finished with the correct completion date.

## Overview

This script takes a unique approach: instead of trying to find Audiobookshelf books from your Goodreads export (which often fails due to title/author variations), it:

1. **Fetches unfinished books from Audiobookshelf** - only books you haven't marked as complete
2. **Searches for matches in your Goodreads export** - using smart fuzzy matching
3. **Updates only matched books** - marks them as finished with the correct read date

This reverse approach is much more effective because Audiobookshelf has cleaner, more consistent metadata than Goodreads exports.

One of the problems I faced was audiobook versions vs. ebook versions, title variations, series
numbering, and author inconsistencies (multiples, narrators, etc).

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Filtering
- **Only processes unfinished books** - reduces scope from 700+ to ~200 books
- Includes books in progress and books with no tracking
- Skips already-finished books automatically

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Matching (90%+ success rate)
- **Multi-stage matching pipeline**:
  1. Exact ISBN match (highest confidence)
  2. Exact title + author match
  3. Fuzzy title + exact author match
  4. Fuzzy title + fuzzy author match
- **Title cleaning** - removes series numbers, subtitles, version info
- **Author normalization** - handles Jr./Sr., initials, translators
- **Author extraction** - pulls author from title when metadata is missing

### ðŸ“Š Detailed Reporting
- Progress tracking for each book
- Confidence scores for matches
- Failed matches saved to log files
- Dry-run mode for testing

## Requirements

- Ruby (tested with 3.0+)
- 1Password CLI (`op`) for credential management
- Goodreads library export CSV
- Audiobookshelf server access

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <this repository-url>
   cd audiobookshelf-sync
   ```

2. **Configure your settings**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.yml config.yml
   ```

   Edit `config.yml` and fill in:
   - Your AudioBookShelf server URLs
   - Your 1Password item names for each server
   - Optional: Adjust batch size, confidence threshold, etc.

3. **Set up 1Password CLI**
   ```bash
   # Install 1Password CLI if not already installed
   # https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/

   # Sign in to your 1Password account
   op signin
   ```

4. **Export your Goodreads library**
   - Go to Goodreads â†’ My Books â†’ Import and export
   - Export your library as CSV
   - Save it as `goodreads_library_export.csv` in the script directory

5. **Create 1Password items for your AudioBookShelf servers**

   For each server, create a 1Password item with:
   - Title: Whatever you specified in `config.yml` (e.g., "abs-primary")
   - Username: Your AudioBookShelf username
   - Password: Your AudioBookShelf password

## Usage

### Test run (recommended first)
```bash
# Test with limited books (set test_limit in config.yml)
ruby sync-reverse-matching.rb
```

### Full sync
```bash
# Remove or increase test_limit in config.yml
ruby sync-reverse-matching.rb
```

### Dry run (see what would be updated without making changes)
```bash
DRY_RUN=true ruby sync-reverse-matching.rb
```

## How It Works

1. **Fetches unfinished books** from your Audiobookshelf library
2. **Loads your Goodreads export** (only "read" books)
3. **Matches books** using intelligent fuzzy matching
4. **Updates progress** in batches of 10 books
5. **Reports results** including match rate and failures

## Matching Algorithm

The script uses sophisticated matching to handle common variations:

- **Series numbering**: "Book 1 - Title" â†’ "Title"
- **Subtitles**: "Title: A Long Subtitle" â†’ "Title"
- **Version info**: "Title (Unabridged)" â†’ "Title"
- **Author variations**: "John Smith Jr." matches "John Smith"
- **Missing authors**: Extracts from "Author Name - Title" format

## Results

Typical results with the reverse matching approach:
- **Match rate**: 85-95% (vs 20-70% with traditional approach)
- **Processing time**: 2-5 minutes for 200 books (but of course, it depends)

## Troubleshooting

### Low Match Rate
- Check if books are in your Goodreads export
- Verify "Exclusive Shelf" is "read" in the CSV
- Look for significant title differences

### Authentication Issues
- Run `op signin` to authenticate 1Password
- Verify item names in `config.yml` match your 1Password items exactly
- Check credentials have `--reveal` permission

### Failed Matches
Check the log files generated for each server:
- `failed_matches_reverse_*.log`

Common reasons:
- Book not in Goodreads export
- Significant title/author differences
- Business/technical books often missing

## Advanced Options

## Configuration Options

In `config.yml`:

- `servers`: Array of server configurations
  - `name`: Friendly name for the server
  - `base_url`: Full URL to your AudioBookShelf server
  - `onepassword_item`: Name of the 1Password item containing credentials
- `batch_size`: Number of books to update in each batch (default: 10)
- `dry_run`: Set to true to test without making changes (default: false)
- `confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence for matches (default: 0.7)
- `test_limit`: Limit number of books for testing (remove for full sync)
- `goodreads_export_file`: Path to your Goodreads CSV export

### Do I have to use 1Password?

No, you can modify the script to use environment variables or a different credential management system.

### Why multiple servers?

Maybe you have a friend that shares their AudioBookShelf with you, or you have multiple servers for
different purposes. This script supports syncing across multiple servers by defining them in the
`config.yml` file.

### Extending Matching
To improve matches, enhance these functions:
- `clean_title()` - Add more title normalization rules
- `process_author()` - Handle additional author formats
- `find_goodreads_match()` - Adjust confidence thresholds
